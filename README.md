### Reflections and Wins 
+ Wins:
  - Learning TypeScript very quickly to incorporate into our application.
  - A clean component library.
  - Collaborating as a frontend team to create extensive functionality in a short time frame.
  - Created an attractive user-friendly site.
+ Reflections:
  - Continuous integration/delivery was a challenge as we stumbled upon a unique error that haulted our CI/CD progress. AS a team we had to make the decision to focus our efforts on the build and deploy manually for the last half of our project.
